<p id="gorl"> Rhegan is 14 years old and a big extrovert, loving to hang out with her friends and family. She also makes youtube vlogs in her free time, along with cooking/baking and watching netflix! Rhegan and her mom have even had their own "Cupcake Wars." Spoiler alert, Reghan won. She's an only child but is very close to her cousins. Rhegan is a first-time scholar of Kode with Klossy! Rhegan lives in Florida, and is an AMAZING gymnast (level 10). Her favorite event out of the 4 is floor. She was homeschooled for 7th and 8th grade, but is going to ODA for her freshman year. Overall, she's a girl who's up for anything whether it's relaxing or having fun traveling :) </p>
